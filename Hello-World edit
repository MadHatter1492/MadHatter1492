Hi, I’m @MadHatter1492
👀 I’m interested in learning how to create a new os for the Amazon fire HD 8 7th generation
🌱 I’m currently learning how to use github also on ways to install or debug the Amazon fire tablet without a PC I only have my cell phone and the tablet is connected to the internet through my cell phones hotspot.so I have learned that by connecting the 2 together using a file manager
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others that are focusing on the same.
